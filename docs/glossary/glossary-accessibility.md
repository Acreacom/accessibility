# Glossary
## Term of Accessibility

### A
  A WCAG standard. see: **_WCAG_**.

### A11y
  Short for _accessibility_, often used as a hashtag - #a11y. Created by combining:

  * **a** - first letter of accessibility
  * **11** - 11 letters between first and last letters of accessibility
  * **y** - last letter

### AA (double A) 
  A WCAG standard. see: **_WCAG_**.

### AAA (treble A)
 A WCAG standard. see: **_WCAG_**.
### Accessibility or Web Accessibility:

* A general term used to describe how easy it is for people to get to, use, and understand things.
* Making web sites, web applications and web services available to all users, regardless of visual, aural, motor, and cognitive abilities. More specifically, web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can contribute to the Web.

Although the term _accessibility_ typically addresses users who have a disability, the concept is not limited to disability issues.

### Accessible description
 The additional information related to an interface element that complements the accessible name. The accessible description may or may not be visually perceivable.

### Accessible name
 The name of a user interface element. Each platform accessibility API provides the accessible name property. The value of the accessible name may be derived from a visible (e.g., the visible text on a button) or invisible (e.g., the text alternative that describes an icon) property of the user interface element.

### Accordion:
 _Originally a musical instrument that expands and contracts, according to the operations of the player._

 *Accordions* is a set of drop-down sections. Expanding the selected section automatically collapses the rest. (Accordions are a list of headers that can be clicked to hide or reveal additional content.)

 An *accordion* is a vertically stacked set of elements, that allow the user to toggle the display of sections of content. Each labeling element can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide its associated content.

### ARIA
 _Short for Accessible Rich Internet Application(s)_

 A metadata specification that provides a means of describing roles, states, and properties for custom widgets so that they are recognizable and usable by assistive technology users. WAI-ARIA also provides a mechanism to ensure that users of assistive technologies are aware of updates in the application.

### Assistive technologies
 Technologies (software or hardware) that increase, maintain or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities when interacting with computers or computer-based systems.

 _Example_: Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:

 * **screen magnifiers**, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;
 * **screen readers**, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;
 * **text-to-speech software**, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
 * **speech recognition software**, which may be used by people who have certain physical disabilities;
 * **alternative keyboards**, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
 * **alternative pointing devices**, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.

### ATAG
 Acronym for the _Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines_**.** Guidelines developed through the WAI for any tool used to put content on the web, including HTML editors (e.g. Sublime), CMS software (e.g. Joomla), video and audio editors (e.g. Audacity)

### Attribute
 Attributes are structural features added to elements to provide information about the states and properties of the object represented by the element.

### Audio description
 Narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone.

### Auditing
 Review of your institution's existing software, electronic platforms and media (digital and otherwise) to determine whether they are up to current standards for digital accessibility.

### Braille Display
 These displays create a tactile translation of information on a computer screen. Some Braille displays have a reusable, refreshable surface, composed of rounded pins that rearrange, to translate information, as it is selected on screen.

### Captions
 Synchronized transcription or translation of the dialogue, sound effects, relevant musical cues, and other relevant audio information needed to understand the media content. Captions can be either closed or open. _Closed captions_ can be turned on or off, whereas _open captions_ are always visible.

### Clickability cues
 A visual indication that a given word or item on a Web page is clickable. Cues that can be used to indicate the clickability of an item include color, underlining, bullets, and arrows.

### Conformance
 Satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification.

### Content (Web content)
 Information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions.

### Color contrast
 Contrast is the perceived difference, between two adjacent colors.

### Contrast Ratio
 A measure of the difference between foreground and background; specific minimal values, including font sizes, are recommended via WCAG 2.0.

### Disability
 A condition that curtails to some degree a person's ability to carry on his normal pursuits; a limitation in an ability. A disability may be partial or total, and temporary or permanent.

### Element:
 _A constituent part of a unit._

 * An HTML tag is known as an _element_, especially when being referred to, using Javascript.
 * A complete HTML block that represents a specific functionality e.g. Accordion, Button, Alert etc.
 * In metadata, the term data _element_ is an atomic unit of data that has precise _meaning_ or precise semantics.
 * A semantic element is an element of code that uses words to clearly represent what that element contains, in human language.

### Focus
 The indication and setting of the actual focused element is essential both for blind and non-blind users using the keyboard. For people with visual disabilities, a method should be provided to enlarge/modify the focus indicator (typically: a dashed rectangle).

There should be a default focusable element on each page and focus should be set to this element when navigating to this page, in case the entire screen changes. For partial screen changes, the focus should remain on the trigger element.

### Head pointer
 A device attached to the user's head that allows a user to move the pointer on the screen, (usually moved by the mouse, a pointing device, the arrow keys, or with the movement of their head). It is useful for people who have limited mobility.

### Hidden
 Indicates that the element is not visible, perceivable, or interactive to any user. An element is considered hidden if it or any one of its ancestor elements is not rendered or is explicitly hidden.

### JAWS
 A popular screen reader software program (Windows only). It uses a synthetic voice to read a computer screen out loud.

### Keyboard accessible
 Accessible to the user using a keyboard or assistive technologies that mimic keyboard input, such as a sip and puff tube.

### Keyboard interface
 Interface used by software to obtain keystroke input.

### Keyboard shortcut
 _A single key or combination of keys that apply a function._

 A combination of keys that, when pressed together, move the user to a different element (HTML block) of the rendered web page. This is sometimes referred to as 'keyboard interaction'.

### Keyboard trap
 Keyboard trap: A situation where a person using the keyboard can not move focus away from the interactive elements or controls, using the keyboard itself.

### Landmark
 A type of region on a page to which the user may want quick access. Content in such a region is different from that of other regions on the page and relevant to a specific user purpose, such as navigating, searching, perusing the primary content, etc.

### Live region
 Perceivable regions of a web page that are typically updated, as a result of an external event when user focus may be elsewhere. These regions are not always updated as a result of a user interaction. WAI-ARIA has provided a collection of properties that allow the author to identify these live regions and process them: aria-live, aria-relevant, aria-atomic, and aria-busy.

### On screen keyboard (or Onscreen keyboard)
 A keyboard that appears on screen, so that a user, who cannot use their hands, can use assistive technology (such as a head pointer) to enter keyboard input. It may also be used for touchscreen input.

### Operable
 Usable by users in ways they can control.

### Perceivable
 Presentable to users, in ways they can sense.

### Property
 Attributes that are essential to the nature of a given object, or that represent a data value associated with the object. A change of a property may significantly impact the meaning or presentation of an object.

### Relationship
 A connection between two distinct things. Relationships may be of various types to indicate which object labels another, controls another, etc.

### Role
 _An actor's part in a play, film, etc._

 * A function assumed or part played by a person or thing in a particular situation.
 * In reference to ARIA, main indicator of type. This semantic association allows tools to present and support interaction with the object in a manner that is consistent with user expectations about other objects of that type.
 * The role of a GUI element. An element can be an alert to the user, an arrow, an object that allows to select a date, a check box, a dialog, a menu etc.

### Screen magnifier
 A software program that magnifies a portion of the screen, so that it can be more easily viewed. Screen magnifiers are used primarily by individuals with low vision.

### Screen reader
 A software program used to allow reading of content and navigation of the screen using speech or Braille output. Used primarily by people who have difficulty seeing. JAWS and NVDA are examples.

### Semantic markup
 Markup (such as HTML) which describes the meaning of document elements, as opposed to their appearance. Semantic tags include headings (&lt;h1> through &lt;h6>), lists (&lt;ol>, &lt;ul>, and &lt;dl>), &lt;strong> and &lt;em>. Non-semantic tags include &lt;div>, &lt;span>, etc.

### Speech synthesizers
 Convert electronic text to speech, and can be used with a variety of access hardware and software.

### Standards or Web standards
 A standard is a set of requirements, specifications, characteristics, or guidelines that can be used to measure products, processes, and services. A standard can provide an incentive for compliance, and may be required by a customer, even though there is no legal requirement for adhering to them.

Web standards include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and WAI-ARIA. Web sites that follow standards are typically more accessible and easier to maintain.

### State
 _The condition an object is in._

 * A state is a dynamic property expressing characteristics of an object that may change in response to user action or automated processes. States do not affect the essential nature of the object, but represent data associated with the object or user interaction possibilities
 * The state of a GUI element. For example an element can be active, editable, focusable, focused, selecta ble, selected etc.

### Tab order
 Manages the list of element on a page that can have the focus (also known as _tab chain_ and _accessibility hierarchy_). These active elements are automatically added to the hierarchy by the browser when it parses the source code. By default, elements are added to the hierarchy in the order they appear in the HTML source of the page (source order).

### Technology (Web content)
 Mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents. _Example_: Some common examples of Web content technologies include HTML, CSS, SVG, PNG, PDF, and JavaScript.

### Transcript
 A text only version of what's said in a movie or television program; they are not real time and they generally are limited to speech only; they are not a recommended substitute for captions.

### UAAG
 Acronym for the **_User Agent Accessibility Guidelines_**. Guidelines developed through the WAI that explain how to make user agents (web browsers, media players, and assistive technologies, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers) accessible to people with disabilities.

### Understandable
 Presentable to users in ways, such that they can construct an appropriate meaning.

### Universal design
 Designing programs, services, tools, and facilities so that they are usable, without additional modification, by the widest range of users possible, taking into account a variety of abilities and disabilities. Also referred to as _inclusive design_, _barrier free design_, _human centered design_, _design-for-all_, _design-first_, _person-first design_, and _universal access_.

### Usability
 A quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word ' _usability_' also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.

### User interface component
 A part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function.

### Validation
 
 * Inspection of a web page to ensure that it conforms to the appropriate standard (i.e. HTML 5.0, CSS, etc.)
 * Inspection of the contents of a user-input form, to ensure that it is safe and correctly completed. This may be done before submission of the form (client-side validation) or after it is submitted (server-side validation). Usually both methods are used, client-side to save resources and not submit a form before it is validated and server-side to make a final check that all is well, after submission.

### Voice recognition
 A software application that enables a computer to accept voice commands. This allows for little or no use of the keyboard and mouse. Also known as _speech recognition_.

### W3C
 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential. W3C is a forum for information, commerce, communication, and collective understanding.

### WAI
 Acronym for the _Web Accessibility Initiative_. The WAI is the sub-project of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) effort to pursue accessibility of the web through technology, guidelines, tools, education and outreach, and research and development.

### WCAG
 Acronym for the _Web Content Accessibility Guidelines_. Guidelines developed through the WAI explaining how to make web content (text, images, forms, multimedia, etc.) accessible to people with disabilities.

 WCAG has 12 guidelines that are organized under four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. The guidelines each have testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, double A (AA), and triple A (AAA).

### Widget
 Discrete user interface object with which the user can interact. Widgets range from simple objects that have one value or operation (e.g., check boxes and menu items), to complex objects that contain many managed sub-objects (eg accordion, carousel, pull-down menus, tabs).
