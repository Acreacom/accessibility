# Understanding assistive technologies
Assistive technologies, sometimes also known as adaptive technologies or accessibility aids, are software or hardware has been specially designed to assist people with disabilities.  Assistive technologies enhance, maintain or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities when interacting with computers or computer-based systems.

Although web developers are not and need not be experts in assistive technologies, they should:
* understand that people can use different devices, 
* understand the meaning of the correct code of their authoring tools and web pages for these devices.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines explicitly state this in principle 4:
> Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Some of the assistive technologies
Here is a list of some of the assistive technologies used in the area of Web accessibility.

### Screen magnifier
A software program that magnifies a portion of the screen, so that it can be more easily viewed. Screen magnifiers help people with low vision. A screen magnifier is like a magnifying glass. People using them are able to control what area of the computer screen they want enlarged, and can move that focus to view different areas of the screen. They are also known as screen enlargers.

### Screen reader
A software program, used to allow reading of content and navigation of the screen, using speech or Braille output. Screen readers are for people who are blind. Screen readers can only translate text-based information. Graphics can be translated, if there is alternative text, describing the visual images. JAWS and NVDA are examples.

### Screen keyboards
A keyboard that appears on screen, which provides an image of a standard or modified keyboard, on the computer screen. On-screen keyboards are used by people who cannot use their hands but can use assistive technology (such as a head pointer, trackball, joystick, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices), to enter keyboard input. They may also be used for touchscreen input.

### Speech synthesizers or Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Speech synthesizers are software or computer devices that convert text written in electronic copies into synthetic speech.

Users who find it difficult to communicate with a computer through their eyesight, for example blind people, can hear text and communicate with the computer through voice.

### Speech recognition or voice recognition programs
Software that captures speech from a microphone or phone and saves it as text or interprets it, as commands, instead of a mouse or keyboard. It may be used by people who have certain physical disabilities. Allows the user, with limited or no arm and hand fine motor control to input text and/or control the user interface via speech. **Note**: The term _voice recognition_ also often refers to software, that is aimed at identifying the person who is speaking.

### An alternative pointing device or alternative input devices
Allows users, with limited or no arm and hand fine motor control, control their computers, through means, other than a standard keyboard or pointing device. Examples include smaller or larger keyboards, joysticks, trackballs, foot pedals, eye-gaze pointing devices, head pointers, sip-and-puff systems controlled by breathing and other special input devices.

### Braille displays
A hardware that provides access to information on a computer screen, by electronically raising and lowering different combinations of pins in braille cells. A braille display can show up to 80 characters from the screen and is refreshable. Using braille display, blind people can navigate through the computer’s desktop, create and edit documents, and browse the Internet.
