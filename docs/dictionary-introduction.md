# Dictionary

**Definition of terminology, in use by the group**

**RFC 1.0 - This is a first draft and a request for comments.**

## Introduction:

As there is always a great danger of confusion, when team members use either the same term for different meanings or different terms for the same meaning, it has been decided to embed the terms that will be in use, during the lifetime of this project, in this expanding document.

**"Ambiguity is the enemy of communication."**

### Methodology:

The language used must always be English but there may be a mix of regional variations of the language.

As with a human language dictionary, terms should be listed in alphabetical order.

The term itself should be first stated, followed by a colon (:), in bold.

This may, optionally, be followed by a short description of the origin of the term, in normal italic text..

This would then be followed by the definition of the term. A definition may have multiple paragraphs, but each paragraph should be indented.

### Template

**An example of a definition:** 

**Keyboard shortcut:** A single key or combination of keys that apply a function.

A combination of keys that, when pressed together, move the user to a different element (HTML block) of the rendered web page. This is sometimes referred to as 'keyboard interaction'.

**Terms with multiple definitions:**

Often, a term may have more than one meaning, dependent upon context. It should be obvious, from that context, which meaning is intended but, if it is not, a different term should be considered for at least one of the definitions.

Multiple definitions should be listed, numbered, in no particular order.

**An example of an entry with multiple meanings:**

**Element:** A constituent part of a unit.

* An HTML tag is known as an _element_, especially when being referred to, using Javascript.
* A complete HTML block that represents a specific functionality e.g. Accordion, Button, Alert etc.
* In metadata, the term data _element_ is an atomic unit of data that has precise _meaning_ or precise semantics.
* A semantic element is an element of code that uses words to clearly represent what that element contains, in human language.
