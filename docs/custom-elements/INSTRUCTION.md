# How to write a Joomla UI component specification?
**Instructions for the author of the specification**

1. Read the existing UI component specifications, including:
- [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1)
- [DHTML Style Guide Working Group](http://access.aol.com/dhtml-style-guide-working-group/)
- [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/components/)
- [EBay MIND Patterns](https://ebay.gitbooks.io/mindpatterns/content/)
- [jQuery API documentation -> Widgets](http://api.jqueryui.com/category/widgets/)
- [USPTO UI Design Library](http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/1.x/docs/index.html)
- [The A11Y Project](http://a11yproject.com/patterns.html)
- [AccDC Technical Style Guide](http://whatsock.com/tsg/)
- [Code Library (Beta) by Deque](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/aria/tabpanels-accordions/sf-responsive-tabs-to-accordion)
   
   **Note**:
   You can complete this list if you find here the specification that is not mentioned here.
   Not all of these specifications describe all of our components

2. Use the Google search to find the articles for the UI component for which you want to prepare the specification. Check out these articles. Pay attention to the opinions of good practice authors.
3. Open the specification template or draft document into this folder.
4. Compile the specification content. Pay attention when copying to avoid unnecessary content, references, comments. Try to customize the document style to the style used in the specifications you have already developed.
