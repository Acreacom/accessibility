# Introduction
## What is it?
This is the repository of documents defining the requirements for the accessibiliity of the Joomla user interface components (Joomla UI components).

User interface component is a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function.

For example: alert, buton, checkobox and accordion, calendar, tabs are the user interface components. 

The goal of the Joomla Accessibility Team is to create a complete documentation of the accessibility of Joomla UI components.

## Who is this documentation for?

This documentation is primarily created for Joomla developers, Joomla extensions developers, webmasters, as well as for testers and accessibility auditors. Documentation will also benefit from those responsible for the accessibility  of websites - administrators, editors, publishers

In the future, this documentation will be synchronized with the [Joomla UI Components](https://joomla-projects.github.io/custom-elements/#/) project documentation.
