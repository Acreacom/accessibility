**Blindness**: Means that people cannot see or recognize anything. This includes cases where people may have a "global" brightness impression only. Blindness can be congenital, or appear later during the life span - then caused by accidents, diseases, or the aging process.

**Cataract**: Cataracts are a cloudiness that is formed in the lens of the eye and may cause poor vision. Most cataracts result from aging and long-term exposure to ultraviolet light. Cataracts get worse over time - the clouded areas become larger and denser. The time taken for this to happen varies from a few months to many years. Cataracts are the leading cause of vision loss among adults of 55 and older.

**Cognitive impairments**: People with cognitive impairments (disabilities) may have trouble reading, for example, auditory processing deficits and attention deficit disorders.

**Color blindness/deficiencies**: These deficiencies belong to the receptor-related impairments and refer to the inability to see colors faithfully or at all. The following two color deficiencies are caused by a malfunction of one or two of the three cone systems: _monochromats_ (two types) and dichromats

**Dichromats**: People with only one malfunctioning cone system can have the following impairments:

* **Protanopia**: Malfunctioning in the red cone system; typically only two (yellow, blue) or three colors (yellow, blue, purple) can be distinguished - yellow comprises red, orange, yellow, and green, blue coincides with blue and purple
* **Deuteranopia**: Malfunctioning in the green cone system; green cannot be distinguished from certain combinations of red and blue; this is the most common type of color deficiency
* **Tritanopia**: Malfunctioning of the blue cone system; longer wavelengths appear as red and the shorter ones as bluish-green; this color deficiency is very rare.

**Dyslexia**: The selective impairment of reading skills despite normal intelligence, sensory acuity, and instruction. Also known as a _reading disorder_ and _developmental dyslexia_. Different people are affected to varying degrees. Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, "sounding out" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.

**Glaucoma**: A neural-related impairment, is often caused when the fluid in the eye does not drain away fast enough. The built up pressure damages the optic nerve and prevents visual information from reaching the brain. Glaucoma typically affects peripheral vision first (tunnel vision), and can cause total blindness if not treated at an early stage.

**Hearing impairments**: People with these impairments may be completely deaf or may have partial loss of hearing.

**Learning disabilities**: A generic term that refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders, manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities.

**Low vision**: A visual impairment, not corrected by standard eyeglasses, contact lenses, medication, or surgery, that interferes with the ability to perform everyday activities. ( _Definition by National Eye Institute_).

**Macular degeneration** (Loss of Central Vision): Belongs to the receptor-related impairments and is damage to or breakdown of the macula and thus a loss of the central vision. Color vision may also be diminished, although peripheral vision and night vision usually remain unaffected.

Macular degeneration may be the result of aging processes in the eye (age-related maculopathy, ARM, also called senile macular degeneration); there are also some other forms of macular degeneration, which are inherited and not associated with aging.

**Mobility impairments**: Diminished mobility. Some people suffer from decreased mobility. This can range from stiffness of fingers due to arthritis to complete paralysis below the neck.

**Monochromacy**: The lack of ability to distinguish colors (and thus the person views everything as if it were on a black and white television). Also known as _total color blindness_.

**Neural-related impairments**: There a two types of neural-related visual impairments: _glaucoma_ and _vision field loss._

**Tunnel vision:** The loss of peripheral vision with retention of central vision, resulting in a constricted circular tunnel-like field of vision.

**Visual impairments**: People with visual impairments range from the totally blind to people who have some difficulty reading small print.
